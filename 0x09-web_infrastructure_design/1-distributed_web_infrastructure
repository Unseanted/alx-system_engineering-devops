Explanation:

- **User:** Initiates a request to access www.foobar.com through a web browser.
- **Domain Name:** www.foobar.com is resolved to the load balancer's IP address (10.0.0.10) by the DNS server.
- **DNS Server:** Resolves the domain name to the load balancer's IP address using DNS records.
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy):** Distributes incoming traffic evenly between the two web servers using a Round Robin algorithm.
  - **Round Robin Distribution Algorithm:** Requests are distributed in a circular sequence to each server in turn.
- **Server 1 and Server 2:** Host the website and consist of:
  - **Nginx (Web Server):** Handles HTTP requests, serves static content.
  - **Application Server:** Executes application logic, interacts with the database.
  - **MySQL (Database):** Stores and manages website data.

### Specifics Explanation:

- **Why Two Servers?:** Introduces redundancy to eliminate a single point of failure (SPOF) and improve fault tolerance.
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy):** Manages traffic distribution to ensure high availability and scalability.
- **Round Robin Algorithm:** Distributes traffic evenly across servers to optimize resource utilization.
- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:**
  - Active-Active: Both servers actively handle requests, evenly distributing the load.
  - Active-Passive: Only one server serves traffic at a time, while the other remains on standby as a backup.
- **Primary-Replica Database Cluster (Master-Slave):**
  - The primary node handles read-write operations, while replica nodes replicate data from the primary for backup and read-only purposes.
- **Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:**
  - The primary node handles write operations and serves as the authoritative source for data changes.
  - Replica nodes replicate data from the primary and serve read-only queries, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - The load balancer represents a single point of failure. If it fails, traffic distribution will be disrupted.
2. **Security Issues:**
   - Lack of a firewall leaves the infrastructure vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks.
   - Lack of HTTPS encryption exposes user data to interception or manipulation.
3. **No Monitoring:**
   - Without monitoring tools, it's challenging to identify performance issues, security breaches, or other anomalies in real-time.
