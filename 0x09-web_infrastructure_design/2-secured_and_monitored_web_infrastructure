### Infrastructure Design:

1. **Firewalls:**
   - Three firewalls are added for security purposes to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
   - They act as barriers between the internal network and the internet, filtering traffic based on predefined security rules.

2. **SSL Certificate & HTTPS:**
   - An SSL certificate is installed on the load balancer to enable HTTPS encryption.
   - HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the web server and the user's browser, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data.

3. **Monitoring Clients (Data Collector):**
   - Monitoring clients, acting as data collectors, gather information about the infrastructure's performance, security, and availability.
   - They send data to a monitoring service (e.g., Sumo Logic) for analysis and visualization.

### Specifics Explanation:

1. **Firewalls:**
   - Added to enforce security policies and protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and potential vulnerabilities.
   
2. **SSL Certificate & HTTPS:**
   - Traffic served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing eavesdropping, data tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - SSL termination at the load balancer enables decryption of HTTPS traffic, allowing the load balancer to inspect and route requests based on their content.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Used to monitor the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure in real-time.
   - Monitoring data collectors gather metrics, logs, and events from various components such as servers, databases, and network devices.

### Monitoring Data Collection:

- Monitoring tools collect data through agents installed on servers, network devices, and other components.
- These agents periodically collect metrics, logs, and events, and send them to the monitoring service for analysis.
- Data collectors may also collect data via APIs, SNMP, or other protocols supported by the monitoring service.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. **SSL Termination at the Load Balancer:**
   - Terminating SSL at the load balancer introduces a potential security risk because decrypted traffic is then forwarded to internal components, potentially exposing sensitive data.

2. **Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:**
   - Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure. If the server fails, it can lead to data loss or downtime.
   - Additionally, it can limit scalability and performance under heavy write loads.

3. **Identical Components Across Servers:**
   - Having servers with identical components (e.g., database, web server, and application server) may lead to homogeneity issues.
   - It can make the infrastructure vulnerable to widespread failures caused by common software or hardware issues.
